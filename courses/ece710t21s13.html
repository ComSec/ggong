                <h2>Course Outline</h2>
                <p>This course introduces some timely topics in communications security research. It covers security architecture and infrastructure, trust and treat models, and practical crypto schemes. Network access authentication protocols, wireless network security, radio air link protection, and security for mobility. Broadcasting and multi-cast security. Security of ubiquitous computing includes protections in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET), vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET), wireless sensor networks (WSN), and radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. Some advanced attacks and hardware protections</p>

                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <p>ECE 419 or ECE 428 or ECE 458, or equivalent courses taken from other departments or universities.</p>
